# react-native-tests
React Native app with examples of Unit Test and UI tests using Jest, Selenium, and Appium.

## Creating a React Native App

### Required Software
1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. To install Expo, run the command `npm install expo-cli --global`

### Creating the Project with Expo
With [Expo](https://expo.io/) tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.
1. To create a new project, run the command `expo init AwesomeProject`
1. Select 'blank' by pressing [Enter]
1. Name your project by typing `AwesomeProject` and then press [Enter]

#### Running the Project
1. Navigate into your new project folder by running the command `cd AwesomeProject`
1. To start the application, run the command `npm start`

### Add Jest to Project
[Jest](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/testing-with-jest/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!
1. To install Jest, run the command `npm i jest-expo --save-dev`
1. Update package.json to include:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    },
    "jest": {
        "preset": "jest-expo"
    }
    ```
1. Create a folder called `__tests__`

## Unit Testing
1. Create a new file called `App.Unit.js`
2. Paste in the following code
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
    import App from '../App';
    
    describe('<App />', () => {
        it('has 1 child', () => {
            const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();
            expect(tree.children.length).toBe(1);
        });
    });
    ```
3. To execute the test, run the command `npm run test App.Unit`

## Mobile UI Testing

### Required Software
1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   * Set your [environment variables](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables)
      * ANDROID_HOME: path to the sdk folder
      * ANDROID_SDK_ROOT: path to the sdk folder
1. (OSX Only) Install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Apple Store
   * Install [XCode Command-line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads)
1. Download and install [Appium Desktop](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/latest)

### Add Appium to Project
[Appium](http://appium.io/) is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol.
1. To install Appium, run the command `npm install --save-dev wd appium appium-doctor`
   * [wd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wd) is the node.js Webdriver/Selenium 2 client.
   * [appium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium) is the appium server.
   * [appium-doctor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium-doctor) attempts to diagnose and fix common Node, iOS, and Android configuration issues before starting Appium.
1. Create a new file in `__tests__` called `App.Appium.js`
1. Paste in the following content
    ```javascript
    import wd from 'wd';

    jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 60000;

    const SERVER_PORT = 4723;
    const SERVER_URL = '0.0.0.0';
    const CAPABILITIES = {
        platformName: 'Android',
        deviceName: 'Android Emulator',
        app: 'C:\\Android\\APK\\AwesomeProject-signed.apk'
    };

    // describe(name, fn) creates a block that groups together several related tests.
    describe('SomeComponent', () => {
        let driver;

        // Before all tests run the following...
        beforeAll(async () => {
            try {
                driver = wd.promiseChainRemote(SERVER_URL, SERVER_PORT);
                await driver.init(CAPABILITIES);
                await driver.sleep(2000);
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(err);
            }
        });

        // After all tests run the following...
        afterAll(async () => {
            try {
                await driver.quit();
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(err);
            }
        });

        // Test
        test('Tests something', async () => {
            // Do stuff
        });

    });
    ```
1. Update `app.json` to include
    ```json
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
    }
    ```

### Setup Android Emulator
An [Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) (AVD) is a configuration that defines the characteristics of an Android phone, tablet, Wear OS, Android TV, or Automotive OS device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator. The AVD Manager is an interface you can launch from Android Studio that helps you create and manage AVDs.
1. Open Android Studio
1. Create an [Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd)
1. Start the AVD
1. Run the react app see [Running the Project](/#running-the-project)
1. Type `a` to sideload the app
1. Enable drawing over app as prompted

### Build the Binary to Test
1. To create an .apk, run the command `expo build:android -t apk`
   * This requires a free Expo account
   * Let Expo handle the process when prompted
   * If you get the error `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:19001` then run the command `npm start` in a new command window and try again
1. Download the .apk from Expo.io
1. Replace the value for `CAPABILITIES.app` with the downloaded file path

### Start Appium Server
1. Open Appium Desktop
1. Select 'Start Server'

#### Save Capabilities
1. Click the 'üîç' (Start Inspector Session) button in the toolbar
1. Click the 'üñâ' (Edit Raw JSON`) button in the 'JSON Representation' pane
1. Update the content to include (change the app path as needed)
    ```json
    {
        "platformName": "Android",
        "deviceName": "Android Emulator",
        "app": "C:\\Android\\APK\\AwesomeProject-signed.apk"
    }
    ```
1. Save your configuration

#### Setup Device
1. Select 'Start Session'
   * This will sideload the app and steup the phone for testing with Appium
1. Select 'X' (Quit Session & Close Inspector)
1. Close the Insepctor window

### Run the Test
The Expo session is not needed and can be closed now if you are following along with this readme. Android studio can also be closed at this point.
<br/>The Android Emulator can be launched via command line, `emulator -avd avd_name [ {-option [value]} ‚Ä¶ ]`
<br/>For example, `C:\Android\SDK\emulator\emulator.exe -avd Nexus_5X_API_29_x86`
<br/>Note: Closing the command prompt will close the Emulator.

To execute the test, run the command `npm run test App.Appium`

## Web UI Testing

### Add Selenium to Project
[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.
1. To install selenium, run the command `npm install --save-dev selenium-webdriver chromedriver`
   * [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) is the official WebDriver JavaScript bindings from the Selenium project.
   * [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) is the ChromeDriver for Selenium.
1. Download `chromedriver` from [Google](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
1. Unarchive the chromedriver and add its directory to your env::PATH variable
   * You will need to download additional components to work with each of the major browsers. The drivers for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft's IE and Edge web browsers are all standalone executables that should be placed on your system [PATH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29). Apple's safaridriver is shipped with Safari 10 for OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra. You will need to enable Remote Automation in the Develop menu of Safari 10 before testing.
1. Create a new file in `__tests__` called `App.Selenium.js`
1. Paste in the following content
    ```javascript
    import { Builder } from 'selenium-webdriver'

    jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 60000;

    const Base_URL = 'https://www.google.com/';

    // describe(name, fn) creates a block that groups together several related tests.
    describe('SomeComponent', () => {
        let driver;

        // Before all tests run the following...
        beforeAll(async () => {
            try {
            driver = new Builder()
                .forBrowser('chrome')
                .build();
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(err);
            }
        });

        // After all tests run the following...
        afterAll(async () => {
            try {
                await driver.quit();
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(err);
            }
        });

        // Test
        test('Tests something', async () => {
            await driver.get(Base_URL);
        });

    });

    ```
### Run the Test
To execute the test, run the command `npm run test App.Selenium`
